Test 4: 70.91






Azure resources cannot be moved if there is a lock (Delete or ReadOnly) on:
 -  resource itself 
 -  Resoruce Group ( source or destination )


NOTE:  Can move a resource that doesn't have a lock and FROM a RG that doesn't have a lock to 
  an RG that has a DELETE LOCK.  The DELETE LOCk on an RG prevents DELETES but allows 
  moves from other RGs to it



A Global Admin of one tenant does not have authority over another tenant
  - Same for User Admin
NOTE: Directory == ME tenant



Requirement for VPN between to VNets: 
 - need gateway subnet for the VPN with /27 or /28 CIDR 


Peering Connection only has to ensure VNets addresses to not overlap


Default Netowrk Security Group Rules: 
 - 65000  |  Allow VNet inbout
 - 65001  |  Allow Load Balancer
 - 65002  |  Allow Deny All




Recovery Services Vault should be in Same Region as VMs

Network Interface needs to be CREATED IN SAME REGION as Virtual Network



BACKUP FACTS: 
 - Azure SQL:  managed service, hence backups done for you
 - Backup Policy Types: 
   - Azure VM             --+  THESE ARE TWO SEPARATE TYPES OF BACKUP POLICIES
   - Azure File Share     --+

LOG ANALYTICS FACT: 
 - Log Analytics workspace can be in ANY REGION.  
   DOES NOT have to be in SAME REGION as Recovery Services Vault
  - Security Events can be sent to Loga Analytics workspace


ME Admin Units only created via:  
  - Azure Portal
  - Microsoft Graph / Powershell

Azure Monitor Insights for Networks provides:
  - Network Health and Metrics
  - Connectivity
  - Traffic
      +-->  provides info about NSG, flow logs and Traffice Analytics


Also Diagnostics toolkit: 
  - Packet Capture
  - VPN Troubleshhoot
  - Connectivity Troubleshhoot
  - Next Hop
  - Traffic Filtering iusses

MFA can be achieved with just an Office Phone or Mobile Phone

Storage Account Live Migration only for LRS or GRS

Azure Site Recovery:  used for DR and DOES NOT Directly address Backup

Azure Container Apps:  microservices / container apps on Serverless

Kubernetes:

Each Pod  gets an IP from subnet:  Azure Continaer Network Interface (CNI)
  - no additional "hop"

Each Node gets an IP from subnet:  Kubenet   
  - extra hop to go from K8s network to "outside" 


ONLY BLOB offers Archive Storage 

App Service Plan:
 - .Net Core can run on Windows or Linux
 - Can move an App to another App Service Plan  in the same
        - Resource Group 
        - Geographic Region


Scale Container Apps, required:   
  - GitHub Account
  - Azure CLI


Can move a Network Interface to a Resource Group in another Region.
   - Can attach resources from multiple resource Groups
NOTE: THe NIC has to be in the same region as the Virtual Network

Location of a Resource DOES NOT CHANGE if moved to ANOTHER Resource Group

Availabilty Set chan have up to 20 update domains **


Availabilty Set                   Availability Zone
Protect HW failures in DC         Protect for entire DC Failuer
SLA 99.95%                        SLA 99.99%


App Service Plan:
  - Can have multiple Apps configured
  - Can run Azure Functions
  - i.e. Server Farm

Policy assigned to a specific scope overrides Subscription Level Policies

VM needs to be part of a VNet 


Stopped (deallocted) resources still have resource count (i.e. CPUs) toward 
Subscription limits.
Quota is calculated based on total number of cores: 
     allocated and deallocated
NOTE: Delete VM to recover resources (CPU)



Storage File Data SMB Share Reader     : read access to Azure Storage file shares for SMB
Storage File Data SMB Share Contributor: read, write, delete access to Azure Storage file shares for SMB
Storage File Data SMB Share Elevated Contributor: read, write and modify Windows ACLs in  Azure file shares for SMB

Azure File supports id-based auth: 
  - on-prem AD
  - ME Domain Services
  - ME Kerberos for hybrid user ids



Azure Bastion requires: 
  AzureBastionSubnet
  CIDR of /26 or larger

Recovery Services Vault: 
  - used with Azure File Shares
  - backup data for Azure Services (IaaS)
  - supports System Center Data Protection Manager, Azure Backup, Windows Server
