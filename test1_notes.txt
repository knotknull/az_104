Read Only lock on subscription means no updates to subscription 
  - hence can't move a web app / App Service Plan to resource group under Read Only Lock subscription



 Can move a resource (i.e. storage account) from a resource group to a 
 destination resource group with a Delete Lock on it 
  - can add resources to a resource group

  Moving Web App Resources (Web App, App Service Plan) to another subscription / (resource group )
     - metadata change
     - Destination resource group  must NOT have any existing App Service resources
            - Web Apps
            - App Service plans
            - Uploaded or imported TLS / SSL certs
            - App Service env



ACL for Azure File granular access for files and directories 
  - ME Domain Services: can configure Windows ACL for fine-grained file and directory level perms          



  Cloud Device Admin: 
     - can enable, disable, deletee devices in ME ID and read Win 10 BitLocker keys in Azure portal


Groups that are Dynamic Device cannot have devices added to them manually



BASIC LOAD BALANCER 
    - VMs need to be in Availability Set or VM Scale Set
    - 300 instances


STANDARD LOAD BALANCER 
    - VMs to be in VM or VMSS in SINGLE VIRTUAL NETWORK
    - 1000 instances


Attach a NIC to a VM both must be in SAME REGION and VIRTUAL NETWORK and Subscription


Resource Groups and Regions:  A Resource Group and all resources contained in can be in DIFFERENT regions.
     HOWEVER, a VM and all it's components should be in same network and region


Recovery Services Vault MUST BE IN SAME REGION AS DATA SOURCE

Blob data CANNOT BE BACKED UP TO Recovery Service Vault  
  -  Azure File Share == Recovery Service Vault



 Device joins ME ID, user of the computer and Global Admin added as local Admin of device


Changing CPU / Memory on Azure Container Instance, DO TWO THINGS: 
 - Delete ACI
 - Redeploy ARM ACI deployment template


ACI Multi-container Group  (similar to AKS pods)
    - collection of containers that run on same host machine
       - shares hosts resources, local network and storage volumes

    - Can be created ONLY on Linux

    - Can include init containers
        init containers: prepare environment for start of application (setup accounts, run scripts, etc)


Enable WORM Storage via BLOB
 - Enable blob versioning
 - Enable version-level immutability


Admin Password Reset ARE NOT ASKED Security Questions
  - ANY Admin (Billing, Security, etc)

Need to delete / recreate a VM when moving to other Regions, netowrks


Restoring a backup on a Win 2016 server 
- install Microsoft Azure Recovery Services Agent

Creating Alerts: 
 - create Log Analytics workspace
 - set VM as data source
 - create Alerts in Mazure Monigor


Virutal Networks can be migrated to different Region
 - Scale sets and Standard Load Balancers cannot be migrated

Blob Versioning: 
 - can be selecitvely applied to individual blobs in a container
 - Blobs of different versons can have different access controls and lifecycles


Web App to use ME ID for auth / auth 
 - Register app in ME ID
 - Set App Service auth settings
 - Select an Identy Provider (Microsoft)




Point to Site (P2S) VPN needs client certificate installed on every client computer 
establishing connectivity Azure VNet 

ME Auth allows connection to Auzre via ME creds.  ME only supports OpenVPN 
and requires Azure VPN Client. 



Record successful / failed connection attempts to VM: 
  - create storage account
  - eneable Azure Network Watcher flow logs
  - ensure to register the Micorsoft.Insights resource provider ****
      - required by NSG Flow Logging


Azure Container Apps
- managed env
- run microservices / container apps on serverless platform
    - event driven processing
    - background processing jobs
    - hosting background 


Private Endpoint Connection need to be "approved" for connection to be established


Create Monitor Rule 
    1. Monitory > Alerts > Create Alert Rule
    2. Set the alert rule scope
    3. Set the alert rule conditions
    4. Set the alert rule actions
    5. Set the alert rule details
    6. Create tags
    7. Finished creating the Rule
