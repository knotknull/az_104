   automatically apply prefix / suffix based on department


Group based licensing can have specific service plans enabled / disabled

Azure Lighthouse: for service providers to manage multiple customer tenants and subscriptions.



ARM Template: ensuring depedent resources are created first: 
  - dependsOn property of VM to reference storage account



BICEP deployment: 
 - parameters are configurage values for deployment
 - variables are computed or static values within file.  Not configurable during deployment




Convert an ARM template to a Bicep file: az bicep decompile     (DECOMPILES TO BICEP)

Convert a Bicep file to an ARM template: az bicep build         (BUILDS AN ARM)



To enable disk encryption automatically, Key Vault and Encryption Key nned to be configured in Deployment Template
  - encrypts OS Disk on creation


When moving VM to a new RG, dependent resources (i.e. VNet, NSG) must be moved prior or moved SIMULTANEOUSLY
   - VNet and NSG are tightly bound to VM


Resize a VM:  
  - Stop VM
  - Resize it (different class)
  - Start



10 Machines into an Availability Set: 
  - distribute across fault and update domains ???
  - what is max number of fault domains ??
  Answer == 3

 NOTE: Availability Sets support 3 Fault Domains per Region  ** 


Azure Container Apps can use Custom Scaling Rules 
  i.e. metrics for queue on depth




Scaling Up or Down an Azure App Service Plan DOES NOT REQUIRE RECREATION
  - can encurr different pricing and services 


When swapping deployment slots, settings that can "tick" with slot are:
 - Connection Strings (i.e. QA DB vs. Prod DB)
 - App Settings (Prod IP Addr vs Dev IP Addr)
 
 This is called "slot settings" 


Steps for setting up a custom domain 
1. portal > Custom Domaind  
2. add custom domain
3. TXT record to verify domain ownership
4. Add CNAME or A Record
5. Validate settings
6. Add TLS / SSL Certificate to bind custom domain


Stored Access Policy for blob 
  - Set Container ACL: set stored access policies anc cofigurs access rules: 
    - start / expire time, perms 

  - Each Stored Access Policy requires unique signed identifier up to 64 chars long.  
      - Identifier links policy to Shared Access Signatures (SAS)

  - Stored Access Policy <-->  Unique Identifier <-->  Shared Access Signature
      - multiple SAS can link to same policy




Azure Storage supports CROSS-REGION access to Azure Key Vault for CMK.
NOTE: Azure Key Vault can have a Firewall Enabled !!




azcopy sync:   ensures incremental uploads by comparing source / destination.  Minimizes bandwidth usage


File Share deleted, only way to recover is to restore ENTIRE Storage Account

Remote Gateway

The Use Remote Gateway setting allows a Peered network to use

Azure Bastion Service requires access:
 - Reader access on Bastion Resource
 - Reader access on the VM
NOTE: Azure Bastion does not require inboud rules for 22 or 3389



With Service Endpoint setup to a Storage Account STILL NEED RBAC permissions to access


Load Balancer without Health Probes will consider all backend VMS as unhealthy and stop forwarding traffic 

Connection Monitor allows you to analyze connectivity across Azure Regions and between On-prem and Azure.



Kusto (KQL) used in:
 - Log Analytics
 - Azure Dashboards 
 - Log Search Alert Rules




NSG flow logs and IP Flow Verify: 
 - can check filtering issues
 - can check NSG issues
