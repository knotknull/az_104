# Policy / RBAC / Admin
###############################################################


Use New-AzRoleDefinition to commit a new role definition
NOTE: Create*

Azure Policy: governance at a resource level  (X group can only use Y resource) 

Perms at the end 
Microsoft.Authorizations/*/read

Admin Password Reset ARE NOT ASKED Security Questions
  - ANY Admin (Billing, Security, etc)

Owner can add user permissions
Security Admin only has privilege with Security Center 


What happens to resources when a policy denies them
A policy that prevents resources  from being created WILL NOT AFFECT EXISTING RESOURCES
 - however will not be able to make updates / changes to exisitng 'banned' resources 


Policies limit resource type creation 
RBAC: Who has access to resources 
  Security Principal (User, Group, Service Principal, Managed Identity)
      + Assign a Role to the above 
Role definition: colleciton of permissions 

Azure Lock: 
 - CanNotDelete     
 - ReadOnly

A Global Admin of one tenant does not have authority over another tenant
  - Same for User Admin
NOTE: Directory == ME tenant

ME Admin Units only created via:  
  - Azure Portal
  - Microsoft Graph / Powershell

Policy assigned to a specific scope overrides Subscription Level Policies

Azure Policy cannot be used for ME (identity layer) only Azure Resources
NOTE: ME ID has a Group Naming Policy for group naming conventions
   automatically apply prefix / suffix based on department

built-in Allowed locations policy can limit where resources are created 
    - deployIfNotExists, existing resources outside of allowed locations can be remediated automatically

Modify effect on Policy allows for existing resources to be in compliance: 
  i.e. ensuring BusinessUnit tag on all new and existing resources

Azure Logic Apps can interface with Azure Services via REST API and can be automated

Deny assignment on Storage Account will override RBAC 

ME User has Job Info section

ME ID 2: Risk based conditional access policies 

B2B Collaboration:  convert external user to an internal user 

Once an alert is created, CAN NOT CHANGE : 
    - Alert Type
    - Alert Name

ARM Alert Template:  Email addresses should be array of strings ?!?

###############################################################
# Subcription
###############################################################

Read Only lock on subscription means no updates to subscription 
  - hence can't move a web app / App Service Plan to resource group under Read Only Lock subscription

Analyzing costs for a subcription 
> Subcription > Cost Analysis

Stopped (deallocted) resources still have resource count (i.e. CPUs) 
toward Subscription limits.
Quota is calculated based on total number of cores: 
     allocated and deallocated
NOTE: Delete VM to recover resources (CPU)

Group based licensing can have specific service plans enabled / disabled

Alert (metric or otherwise) at the subscription level will be applied to any new resources to subscription

Budget in Azure cost management can send notifications on upcoming threshold

###############################################################
# Move Resources
###############################################################

 Can move a resource (i.e. storage account) from a resource group to a 
 destination resource group with a Delete Lock on it 
  - can add resources to a resource group

  Moving Web App Resources (Web App, App Service Plan) to another subscription / (resource group )
     - metadata change
     - Destination resource group  must NOT have any existing App Service resources
            - Web Apps
            - App Service plans
            - Uploaded or imported TLS / SSL certs
            - App Service env

Can move a Network Interface to a Resource Group in another Region.
   - Can attach resources from multiple resource Groups
NOTE: THe NIC has to be in the same region as the Virtual Network


###############################################################
# ME - ID / Azure AD / DNS
###############################################################

ACL for Azure File granular access for files and directories 
  - ME Domain Services: can configure Windows ACL for fine-grained file and directory level perms          

  Cloud Device Admin: 
     - can enable, disable, deletee devices in ME ID and read Win 10 BitLocker keys in Azure portal

Groups that are Dynamic Device cannot have devices added to them manually
 
 Device joins ME ID, user of the computer and Global Admin added as local Admin of device


ME Auth allows connection to Auzre via ME creds.  ME only supports OpenVPN 
and requires Azure VPN Client. 

Steps for adding a custom domain to ME  ID:
 - Add custom domain name to ME ID
 - Add record to the public xyz.com DNS zone
 - Verify the domain

Steps for setting up a custom domain 
1. portal > Custom Domaind  
2. add custom domain
3. TXT record to verify domain ownership
4. Add CNAME or A Record
5. Validate settings
6. Add TLS / SSL Certificate to bind custom domain

Custom Domain:  Add TXT record to Domain Register
CAA == Certificate Authorities
SPF == Sender Policy Framework (mail)
NS == authoritative name server within domain or DNS zone


MFA can be achieved with just an Office Phone or Mobile Phone

Azure Policy cannot be used for ME (identity layer) only Azure Resources
NOTE: ME ID has a Group Naming Policy for group naming conventions
   automatically apply prefix / suffix based on department

Azure Lighthouse: for service providers to manage multiple customer tenants and subscriptions.

DNS Private Zone  w/ VNet Linking: 
    - Manage DNS records for private domains across regions / multiple VNets

Private DNS zone provides resolution for pirvate end points

###############################################################
# Load Balancer
###############################################################

BASIC LOAD BALANCER 
    - VMs need to be in Availability Set or VM Scale Set
    - 300 instances

STANDARD LOAD BALANCER 
    - VMs to be in VM or VMSS in SINGLE VIRTUAL NETWORK
    - 1000 instances

Standard Load Balancer serving 2 or more VM will be availble 99.99%

Load Balancer without Health Probes will consider all backend VMS as unhealthy and stop forwarding traffic 

###############################################################
# VM / NIC
###############################################################

Attach a NIC to a VM both must be in SAME REGION and VIRTUAL NETWORK and Subscription

Need to delete / recreate a VM when moving to other Regions, netowrks

Adding a NIC to a VM:   Must Stop VM First 

Public IP Addresses are only allocated to started instances

NIC can have a Public and a Private IP address

Create Availability Sets for the number of tiers of you application  
i.e. 2 for Web and DB


Fault Domain :  3 
Update Domain: 20 
Availabilty Set chan have up to 20 update domains **

VMs can be auto registered to a virtual newtowrk with a DNS private zone.

Availability Set  has SLA of 99.95% VM updatime    ## Protect HW Failures in a Data Center
Availability Zone has SLA of 99.99% VM updatime    ## Protect for entire Data Center failure

Move a VM with Azure Disk Encryuption integrated with Key Vault
  - can be moved to another Resource Group in deallocated state

Moving  to another subscription, need to disable encryption

az vm encryption disable --resource-group demoRG --name myVm1 --volume-type all

az vm deallocate --name vmname  --rsource-group oldRG                 # Stop the VM
az group create  --name newR    --location newRegion                  # create new RG in new Region
az vm create  --name new_vm     --resource-group new_RG  --location newRegion --source oldRG     # Move VM to new RG in new Region
az vm wait   --name vmname       --resource-group oldRG  --deleted    # Move VM to new RG in new Region


Adding Data Disk to existing VM

New-AzDiskConfig
New-AzDisk
Get-AzVM        # VM Exists already
Add-AzVMDataDisk
Update-AzVM


Update Disk Size

Get-AzVM        # VM Exists already
Stop-AzVM       # Stop before resizing
$disk=Get-AzDisk  # Get a reference to OS or Data Disk
i.e. 
      $disk= Get-AzDisk -ResourceGroupName $azResourceGroup -DiskName $vm.StorageProfile.OsDisk.Name     ## OS 
      $disk= Get-AzDisk -ResourceGroupName $azResourceGroup -DiskName $vm.StorageProfile.DataDisks[0].Name   # First Data Disk

$disk.DiskSizeGB = 250    # Update the size

Update-AzDisk             # Update the Disk Image 
      Update-AzDisk -ResourceGroupName $azResourceGroup -Disk $disk -DiskName $disk.Name

Start-AzVM      # Restart the VM

VM needs to be part of a VNet 
  - Can't have a VM without a VNet 

When moving VM to a new RG, dependent resources (i.e. VNet, NSG) must be moved prior or moved SIMULTANEOUSLY
   - VNet and NSG are tightly bound to VM

Resize a VM:  
  - Stop VM
  - Resize it (different class)
  - Start

Proximity Placement Group: reduces latency between co-hosted VMs in the same zone


VMSS Extensions + Applications: VM Scale Sets settings for Env Vars and init scripts  
    - separates config from app / VM image

###############################################################
# Resource Groups
###############################################################

Resource Groups and Regions:  A Resource Group and all resources contained in can be in DIFFERENT regions.
     HOWEVER, a VM and all it's components should be in same network and region

Azure resources cannot be moved if there is a lock (Delete or ReadOnly) on:
 -  resource itself 
 -  Resoruce Group ( source or destination )


NOTE:  Can move a resource that doesn't have a lock and FROM a RG that doesn't have a lock to 
  an RG that has a DELETE LOCK.  The DELETE LOCk on an RG prevents DELETES but allows 
  moves from other RGs to it

Location of a Resource DOES NOT CHANGE if moved to ANOTHER Resource Group


Can move a Network Interface to a Resource Group in another Region.
   - Can attach resources from multiple resource Groups
NOTE: THe NIC has to be in the same region as the Virtual Network

VM Scale Set w/ Azure Desired State Config (DSC)
    - DSC used to setup production software on VM (i.e. IIS)


###############################################################
# Backup / Recovery Services
###############################################################

Recovery Services Vault MUST BE IN SAME REGION AS DATA SOURCE

Blob data CANNOT BE BACKED UP TO Recovery Service Vault  
  -  Azure File Share == Recovery Service Vault

Restoring a backup on a Win 2016 server 
- install Microsoft Azure Recovery Services Agent

Need to set Revery Services Vault in same region as source

Azure Backup Center / Vault 
  - can create snapshots, snapshot life cycle 
  - Agentless backup 
  - Backup Policy

BACKUP FACTS: 
 - Azure SQL:  managed service, hence backups done for you
 - Backup Policy Types: 
   - Azure VM             --+  THESE ARE TWO SEPARATE TYPES OF BACKUP POLICIES
   - Azure File Share     --+

Azure Site Recovery:  used for DR and DOES NOT Directly address Backup

Recovery Services Vault: 
  - used with Azure File Shares
  - backup data for Azure Services (IaaS)
  - supports System Center Data Protection Manager, Azure Backup, Windows Server

To initiate a failover:
    Recovery Services Vault > Select recouce > click "Failover"

Recovery Vault                      Backup Vault
VM                                  Azure DB for PostgreSQL
SQL in Azure VM                     Azure  Blobs
Azure Files                         Azure Disks

###############################################################
# Container / Container App / AKS 
###############################################################

Changing CPU / Memory on Azure Container Instance, DO TWO THINGS: 
 - Delete ACI
 - Redeploy ARM ACI deployment template

ACI Multi-container Group  (similar to AKS pods)
    - collection of containers that run on same host machine
       - shares hosts resources, local network and storage volumes

    - Can be created ONLY on Linux

    - Can include init containers
        init containers: prepare environment for start of application (setup accounts, run scripts, etc)

Azure Container Apps
- managed env
- run microservices / container apps on serverless platform
    - event driven processing
    - background processing jobs
    - hosting background 

Steps for creating ACR: 
- Create ACR
- Choose pricing tier
- Configure ACR
- Setup Auth / Security
- Access / Manage Container images


Azure Container Apps:  microservices / container apps on Serverless

Kubernetes:

Each Pod  gets an IP from subnet:  Azure Continaer Network Interface (CNI)
  - no additional "hop"

Each Node gets an IP from subnet:  Kubenet   
  - extra hop to go from K8s network to "outside" 


Scale Container Apps, required:   
  - GitHub Account
  - Azure CLI

Azure Container Apps can use Custom Scaling Rules 
  i.e. metrics for queue on depth

Microsoft Defender for Containers: automatically scans images in ACR

Azure Traffic Manager: DNS-based traffic routing that can distribute requests across multiple 
    ACI deployments in various regions

Wildcard SSL certificate can handle multiple subdomains with one certificate 
    i.e. certificate for *.example.com can secure app.example.com, dev.example.com, etc.
    - NOTE: App Services supports binding wildcard SSL certs to custom domains.

###############################################################
# App Service / Plan
###############################################################

Azure App Service Deployment Slots:
 - A slot will create a new web address for Web App Service
 - Can swap between Prod and non-Prod for the slot


Azure App Service: Deployment Slot
  - each slot a separate instance of web app
  - each slot has separate hostname
  - different versions to each slot
  - 1 slot is Production slot
  - other slots: integration, acceptance, capacity tests
  - deploy by swapping Production slot with the new version slot
    - slot swap is instantaneous
    - slot hostnames are exchanged, immediately sending prod traffice to new version
  - rollback by swapping back

When swapping deployment slots, settings that can "stick" with slot are:
 - Connection Strings (i.e. QA DB vs. Prod DB)
 - App Settings (Prod IP Addr vs Dev IP Addr)
 
 This is called "slot settings" 

Slots are separate Azure resources

App Service Plan: Slots / Tiers 
    Tier            Max staging slots
  Free                    0 
  Shared                  0 
  Basic                   0 
  Standard                5
  Premium                20
  Isolated               20    

Auto-swap allows for swapping Stage slot with Prouction slot once deploymnet is complete.


Azure App Service hostnames:
<app_name>-<random-hash>.<region>.azurewebsites.net


App Service Plan:
 - .Net Core can run on Windows or Linux
 - Can move an App to another App Service Plan  in the same
        - Resource Group 
        - Geographic Region
 - Can have multiple Apps configured
 - Can run Azure Functions
 - i.e. Server Farm


Scaling Up or Down an Azure App Service Plan DOES NOT REQUIRE RECREATION
  - can encur different pricing and services

  - can check current / historic al network topoligy between source and desitination endpoints

Connection Monitor allows you to analyze connectivity across Azure Regions and between On-prem and Azure.

Azlerts in Azure Monitor for Activity Logs

Service Health Service:  used to inform health of Azure-based Services

LOG ANALYTICS FACT: 
 - Log Analytics workspace can be in ANY REGION.  
   DOES NOT have to be in SAME REGION as Recovery Services Vault
 - Security Events can be sent to Loga Analytics workspace

Azure Monitor Insights for Networks provides:
  - Network Health and Metrics
  - Connectivity
  - Traffic

# VNets / Subnets / NSG / Gateway / VPN Gateway 
###############################################################
Virutal Networks can be migrated to different Region
 - Scale sets and Standard Load Balancers cannot be migrated


Web App to use ME ID for auth / auth 
 - Register app in ME ID
 - Set App Service auth settings
 - Select an Identy Provider (Microsoft)

Point to Site (P2S) VPN needs client certificate installed on every client computer 
establishing connectivity Azure VNet 


Private Endpoint Connection need to be "approved" for connection to be established

Virtual Network can have multiple address spaces i.e.:
  10.0.*
  192.168.*

Cannot Peer Virtual Networks with overlapping CIDR i.e.  
10.11.0.0/16 -   Cannot be peered tother
10.11.0.0/17 -

Peering is bidrectional when both networks are peered with each other

Install Exported certifiate for P2S connection.
.pfx file w/ entire certificate chaing 

VPN uses Gateway Subnet
  - Gateway Subnet with CIDR /27 or /28

445 == SMB port
2049 == NFS Port 

NSG:
If you specify an outbound security rule to any address over port 80, for example, 
it's not necessary to specify an inbound security rule for the response to the outbound traffic. 
You only need to specify an inbound security rule if communication is initiated externally (i.e. 80, 443). 
The opposite is also true. If inbound traffic is allowed over a port, it's not necessary to specify an 
outbound security rule to respond to traffic over the port.


Requirement for VPN between to VNets: 
 - need gateway subnet for the VPN with /27 or /28 CIDR 
 

Peering Connection only has to ensure VNets addresses to not overlap

Default Netowrk Security Group Rules: 
 - 65000  |  Allow VNet inbout
 - 65001  |  Allow Load Balancer
 - 65002  |  Allow Deny All

Network Interface needs to be CREATED IN SAME REGION as Virtual Network

Azure Bastion requires: 
  - subnet named AzureBastionSubnet
  - CIDR of /26 or larger

With Service Endpoint setup to a Storage Account STILL NEED RBAC permissions to access

Azure Bastion Service requires access:
 - Reader access on Bastion Resource
 - Reader access on the VM
NOTE: Azure Bastion does not require inboud rules for 22 or 3389

Azure Bastion needs to be deployed PER REGION

# ARM Template / BICEP / Deployments
###############################################################

Export a template for an Azure deployment 
  Save-AzResourceGroupDeploymentTemplate

Deploying a resource via Resource Manager Template: 
az deployment group create 
     -- name       
     -- resource-group       
     -- template-file  resource.json 


ARM Template: ensuring depedent resources are created first: 
  - dependsOn property of VM to reference storage account

BICEP deployment: 
 - parameters are configurage values for deployment
 - variables are computed or static values within file.  Not configurable during deployment


Convert an ARM template to a Bicep file: az bicep decompile     (DECOM"BI"LES TO BICEP)

Convert a Bicep file to an ARM template: az bicep build         (BUILDS AN ARM)

To enable disk encryption automatically, Key Vault and Encryption Key nned to be configured in Deployment Template
  - encrypts OS Disk on creation

Parts of ARM template:
- parameters
- variables
- resources (optional)
- output (optional)

Parts of BICEP
- parameters
- variables
- resources (optional)
- modules (optional)
- output (optional)

Parameters used to dynamically apply values to templates (i.e. different skus for envs (dev, uat, prod, etc))

Parameter Validation Block: restricts parameter values to a certain set:

param sku string = 'Standard_LRS' {
    allowed: [
        'Standard_LRS'
        'Premium_LRS'
    ]
}

Deployments at resource group with template file and parameters file: 
az deployment group create --resource-group MyRG --template-file temp.json --parameters parms.json
