Limit access to a Storage Account : 
  Storage Account > Networking > Selected Networks
  - virtual networks
  - firewall: IP Addr range

What happens to resources when a policy denies them
A policy that prevents resources  from being created WILL NOT AFFECT EXISTING RESOURCES
 - however will not be able to make updates / changes to exisitng 'banned' resources 




Install Exported certifiate for P2S connection.

VMs can be auto registered to a virtual newtowrk with a DNS private zone.



Azure App Service: Deployment Slot
  - each slot a separate instance of web app
  - each slot has separate hostname
  - different versions to each slot
  - 1 slot is Production slot
  - other slots: integration, acceptance, capacity tests
  - deploy by swapping Production slot with the new version slot
    - slot swap is instantaneous
    - slot hostnames are exchanged, immediately sending prod traffice to new version
  - rollback by swapping back

Slots are separate Azure resources

App Service Plan: Slots / Tiers 
    Tier            Max staging slots
  Free                    0 
  Shared                  0 
  Basic                   0

  Premium                20
  Isolated               20    


Azure App Service hostnames:
<app_name>-<random-hash>.<region>.azurewebsites.net


Deploying a resource via Resource Manager Template: 

az deployment group create 
     -- name       
     -- resource-group       
     -- template-file  resource.json 

Policies limit resource type creation 
RBAC: Who has access to resources 
  Security Principal (User, Group, Service Principal, Managed Identity)
      + Assign a Role to the above 
Role definition: colleciton of permissions 


Azure Lock: 
 - CanNotDelete     
 - ReadOnly

IP Flow Verify: 
  - check if network rule is preventing packet to destination
  - determines if packet denied by security group, name of rule

Connection Monitor:
  - determine connectivty between VM and external host
  - monitors communication at regulat intervals  
  - detects changes in reachability and latency
  - can check current / historic al network topoligy between source and desitination endpoints


Availability Set  has SLA of 99.95% VM updatime
Availability Zone has SLA of 99.99% VM updatime



Azure Blob Types: 

Block Blobs
  - composed of blocks.  Ideal for text or binary files, uploading large files efficiently

Append Blobs
  - composed of blocks optimized of append ops.  Ideal for logging

Page Blobs
  - collection of 512-byte pages, frequent random read/write. up to 8 TB
    PAGE BLOBS foundation of Azure IaaS Disks


Azure Backup Center / Vault 
  - can create snapshots, snapshot life cycle 
  - Agentless backup 
  - Backup Policy


Move a VM with Azure Disk Encryuption integrated with Key Vault
  - can be moved to another Resource Group in deallocated state

Moving  to another subscription, need to disable encryption

az vm encryption disable --resource-group demoRG --name myVm1 --volume-type all

az vm deallocate --name vmname  --rsource-group oldRG                 # Stop the VM
az group create  --name newR    --location newRegion                  # create new RG in new Region
az vm create  --name new_vm     --resource-group new_RG  --location newRegion --source oldRG     # Move VM to new RG in new Region
az vm wait   --name vmname       --resource-group oldRG  --deleted    # Move VM to new RG in new Region




Storage Account Contributor  :  Manage Storage Accounts, access to account ky

Storage Blob Data Contributor:  Read, write, delete, Azure Storage containers and blobs

Storage Blob Data Owner      :  Full access to Azure Storage blob containers and Data includng POSIC access control


Azure Export to move data OUT of Azure Storage Account 
  -  Uses Azure Blob Storage


Adding Data Disk to existing VM

New-AzDiskConfig
New-AzDisk
Get-AzVM        # VM Exists already
Add-AzVMDataDisk
Update-AzVM


Update Disk Size

Get-AzVM        # VM Exists already
Stop-AzVM       # Stop before resizing
$disk=Get-AzDisk  # Get a reference to OS or Data Disk
i.e. 
      $disk= Get-AzDisk -ResourceGroupName $azResourceGroup -DiskName $vm.StorageProfile.OsDisk.Name     ## OS 
      $disk= Get-AzDisk -ResourceGroupName $azResourceGroup -DiskName $vm.StorageProfile.DataDisks[0].Name   # First Data Disk

$disk.DiskSizeGB = 250    # Update the size

Update-AzDisk             # Update the Disk Image 
      Update-AzDisk -ResourceGroupName $azResourceGroup -Disk $disk -DiskName $disk.Name

Start-AzVM      # Restart the VM



formate of prefixMatch is container/folder:   demo/data

granular Access for a limited time
  - Shared Access Signature


Azlerts in Azure Monitor for Activity Logs

Service Health Service:  used to inform health of Azure-based Services


VPN uses Gateway Subnet
  - Gateway Subnet with CIDR /27 or /28


If you specify an outbound security rule to any address over port 80, for example, 
it's not necessary to specify an inbound security rule for the response to the outbound traffic. 
You only need to specify an inbound security rule if communication is initiated externally. 
The opposite is also true. If inbound traffic is allowed over a port, it's not necessary to specify an 
outbound security rule to respond to traffic over the port.
